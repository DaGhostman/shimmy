# Pre-commit hooks for Shimmy
# Fast quality checks that run on EVERY commit
# Regression tests run separately on PRs and releases (too slow for pre-commit)

# NOTE: Regression tests (115 tests, ~60-100s) are NOT run on every commit
# They run automatically on:
# - Pull requests (GitHub Actions CI)
# - Release workflow (scripts/dry-run-release.sh Gate 5)
# 
# To run manually: cargo test --all-features
# Or use: ./scripts/run-regression-tests.sh
